# SolidStart SSE Chat
Basic Chat demonstration with [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (SSE) for server to client communication. (Uses [this workaround](https://github.com/peerreynders/solid-start-sse-counter) so that the Node.js server can detect when the client closes the SSE request.)

If HTTP/1.1 compatibility is desired a client application shouldn't use more that one SSE connection as there is a limit of 6 connections per domain on a browser (the limit is significantly higher with HTTP/2). Typically SSE is less resource intensive compared to [WebSockets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) (which aren't part of the HTTP spec either). 

With HTTP/3 both will likely be replaced with [WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/) ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API), [web.dev](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/webtransport/)).

For [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)s the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#authoring-notes) recommends:

> Clients that support HTTP's per-server connection limitation might run into trouble **when opening multiple pages from a site if each page has an `EventSource` to the same domain**. Authors can avoid this using the relatively complex mechanism of using unique domain names per connection, or by allowing the user to enable or disable the `EventSource` functionality on a per-page basis, or by sharing a single `EventSource` object using a [shared worker](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#sharedworkerglobalscope). 

From that perspective it's likely a mistake to create an `EventSource` inside an ordinary component as it may be construed from [the remix-utils `useEventSource()` example](https://github.com/remix-run/examples/blob/c59ee8eb2b06002b22d53e91df48a0b77b49091c/sse-counter/app/root.tsx) (the example *does* actually only use it in the top-level `App` component though that detail is easily missed.).

Here the `EventSource` is centrally handled in [`message-context`](./src/components/message-context.tsx) where the messages are processed into a [store](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#using-stores) which itself is made accessible via a [context](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createcontext) to the rest of the application.

Ideally in a larger application with multiple server-to-client information streams, the streams should be multiplexed onto a single SSE connection and demultiplexed client-side into the appropriate parts of client state.

To force the application to use the [long polling](https://javascript.info/long-polling#long-polling) fallback [instead of SSE](./src/components/message-context.tsx):

```TypeScript
// file: src/components/message-context
// â€¦

// Use `if(info.streamed === undefined) {` to force error to switch to long polling fallback
if (info.streamed) {

// â€¦
```
